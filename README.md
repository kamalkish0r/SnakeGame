# 🐍 Snake Game Project

## 📝 Description
This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game, designed with a focus on scalability, extensibility, and learning software design principles. The game will be developed in Java and will feature multiple difficulty levels and gameplay variations.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. ✅ Implement a functional Snake game.
2. 🧠 Explore and apply principles of scalable and extensible software design.
3. 🔄 Incrementally add features and difficulty levels.
4. 🔍 Analyze the impact of changes on the existing codebase.

## 📦 Versions and Features

### v1.0 - Basic Implementation

* 🟩 Simple snake movement (up, down, left, right)
* 🍏 Food generation
* 🚧 Basic collision detection (walls and self)
* 🏆 Score tracking
* 💀 Game ends when snake hits the wall or itself

### v1.1 - Wall Pass-Through Mode

* 🚪 Implement new game mode: Wall Pass-Through
    * 🔄 Snake re-enters from the opposite wall when hitting a wall
* 🎮 Allow users to choose between **Classic and Wall Pass-Through** modes


### v1.2 - Speed Variations

* 🏃‍♂️ Implement multiple snake speeds
* 🎚️ Add difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
    * 🐢 **Easy**: Slow snake speed
    * 🐍 **Medium**: Moderate snake speed
    * ⚡ **Hard**: Fast snake speed
* 🎮 Allow users to choose difficulty level at game start

### v1.3 - Obstacles

* 🧱 Add stationary obstacles on the game board
* 🚶‍♂️ Implement moving obstacles
* 🆕 New game mode: Obstacle Course
    * 🧩 Combines obstacles with either Classic or Wall Pass-Through mode

### v1.4 - Power-ups

* 🌟 Implement power-ups that appear randomly:
    * 💨 **Speed boost**
    * 🔢 **Score multiplier**
    * 🛡️ **Temporary invincibility**
* 💡 Power-ups available in all game modes



## 🎮 Game Modes

* 🕹️ **Classic**: Snake dies upon hitting walls or itself
* 🚪 **Wall Pass-Through**: Snake re-enters from the opposite wall
* 🧩 **Obstacle Course**: Adds obstacles to either Classic or Wall Pass-Through mode

## ⚖️ Difficulty Levels

* 🐢 **Easy**: Slow snake speed, fewer obstacles
* 🐍 **Medium**: Moderate snake speed, average number of obstacles
* ⚡ **Hard**: Fast snake speed, more obstacles
